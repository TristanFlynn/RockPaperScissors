# RockPaperScissors

This project is going to operate a game of rock, paper & scissors by:

  1. Create three buttons (Rock / Paper / Scissors)
  2. Add "On-click" listener to each button which will initiate each round of the game
  3. Clicked button will generate user's move, while "ComputerMove" will be generated randomly.
  4. Result function will be attached to each button as well. Rock beats scissors. Paper beats rock, Scissors beat paper.

Once the game can operate. Create a scoreboard that will tally each win between the user and the computer.

First to two wins will win the game.
